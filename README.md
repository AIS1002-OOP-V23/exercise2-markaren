# Exercise2 - week4

### Exercise 1 - misc functions
Implement the functions located in [exercise1.hpp](include/ais1002/exercises/exercise1.hpp).

### Exercise 2 - Random generator
Implement the function located in [exercise2.hpp](include/ais1002/exercises/exercise2.hpp).  
Use the class `real_random_generator` located in
[real_random_generator.hpp](include/ais1002/real_random_generator.hpp)   
as the basis for your implementation.

### Exercise 3 - Using an API
Implement the functions located in [exercise3.hpp](include/ais1002/exercises/exercise3.hpp).  
The idea is to make use of existing API functions in [vector3](include/ais1002/vector3.hpp) 
and [matrix4](include/ais1002/matrix4.hpp). <br>
_So make sure you look at the source code!_
